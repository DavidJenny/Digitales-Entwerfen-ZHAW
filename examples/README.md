# A folder with Sample Definition/Scripts

In this folder we will store some basic scripts that can help you get started!
In the 01 folder there you will find a few examples that explain what a few basic components do. I advise going over them
In the 02_ParmetricTowerExercise folder each file is a different successive step in bulding the final definition for creating a building model

You can download either the whole folder or one by one the examples by right clicking on a script and click on "save link as"
